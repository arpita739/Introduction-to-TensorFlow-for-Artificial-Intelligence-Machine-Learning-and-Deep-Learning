# Introduction-to-TensorFlow-for-Artificial-Intelligence-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
This course by deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization teaches you how to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that you can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems. To develop a deeper understanding of how neural networks work. I did this course and here in this repository you will find all the exercises regarding the course.
